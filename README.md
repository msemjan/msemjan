- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @msemjan
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science, programming and physics

Here are few of my personal projects:
- [GPGPU implementation of the Metropolis Algorithm](https://github.com/msemjan/MC_MA_IAKL)
  - My implementation of the Metropolis Algorithm for the Ising model on the kagome lattice in CUDA parallel programming framework
- [KMeans](https://github.com/msemjan/kmeans) 
  - My implementation of KMeans clustering algorithm from scratch 
  - Written in C++
- [YATL - Yet Another Todo List](https://github.com/msemjan/yatl) 
  - A simple single-user web app to manage your tasks
  - Written in: Python, Flask framework, Jinja2 template engine, SQLite3, (very simple) CSS and HTML
- [Arxiv Search](https://github.com/msemjan/arxiv)
  - A simple script to search scientific papers on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/) and download them
  - Written in Python, uses BeautifulSoup4 to scrape XML responses from Arxiv API
- [Wine quality prediction](https://github.com/msemjan/wine-quality-prediction)
  - A beginner data science project (regression)
  - Goal is to predict quality of a wine sample on the scale from 0 to 10
  - I've employed a couple Sklearn regressors and compared their performance
  - I've used: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Sklearn, Seaborn and Matplotlib
- [Stellar classification](https://github.com/msemjan/stellar_classification)
  - A beginner data science project (classification)
  - Goal was to predict the star type
  - The execution times and accuracy of several sklearn classifiers was compared
- [Crypto prices](https://github.com/msemjan/crypto_prices)
  - A simple script that fetches buy and sell prices of a couple of selected crypto currencies using Coinbase API
  - This way you can watch how bad your investment in crypto was from the comfort of your terminal 
  - Written in Python
- [Scraping historical prices of crypto](https://github.com/msemjan/scraping_coinmarketcap)
  - A web scraping project to obtain historical prices of crypto from CoinMarketCap
  - Written in Python, uses BeautifulSoup4
